# GraphQL Next training

---

This time, we go fullstack using the next framework.

The GraphQL API is contained in the api folder of the project and all content is rendered through static content.
Just run the project and the app will be self sufficient ! No need to access an external API.

The API fetches all data from the [Rick & Morty REST API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/).

You can access the Apollo playground interface at http://localhost:3000/api/graphql once the project is started. This will allow you to play with the available schemas.
